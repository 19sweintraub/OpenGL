1.) A uniform variable is a variable that can be accessed by all threads in the GPU when doing a calculation and does not change during execution of the shader program. 
The 'in' and 'out' keywords define which variables are being passed in and out of the shader program. Vertex shaders pass data to a fragment shader via Vertex Buffer Objects.

2.) attrPos and unifModel are both handles. These handles are used to point a shader to information in a VBO. The values are assigned when the the surface shader program is initialized.
The initialization uses gl's getAttributeLocation function to assign a unique handle ID if the variable exists.
